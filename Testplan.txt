UNIT TESTS [If everything is running right then the Unit Tests will only print the 
            output from the output streaming operator of the respective class and nothing else]

1. Booking

- Check static constants (Note that these constants are changeable from the Application space 
                            and the tests are only for verifying if their value is being set properly.
                            The tests below are based on the values currently set and may be changed by the user of the Application.)

    STATIC CONSTANTS    GOLDEN VALUE
    --------------------------------
    sBaseFarePerKM      0.50
    sACSurcharge        50.00
    sLuxuryTaxPercent   25

- Check next available PNR

    STATIC              GOLDEN VALUE
    --------------------------------
    sBookingPNRSerial   one more than 
                        total number of 
                        bookings

- Do a booking and check the different attributes

    Booking from Delhi to Mumbai by AC 3 Tier for 16 March, 2021
    
    ATTRIBUTE       GOLDEN VALUE
    ----------------------------
    fromStation_    Delhi
    toStation_      Mumbai
    date_           16/Mar/2021
    bookingClass_   AC3Tier
    fare_           1316
    pnr_            1
    bookingStatus_  true
    bookingMessage_ BOOKING SUCCEEDED

- Check ComputeFare function separately matching its return value with the golden value of fare_
- Check that the booking has been added to the static vector sBookings
- Check that the next available PNR is now 2
- Check the output streaming operator on the above booking


2. Station

Create a station Mumbai

- Check the name_ attribute and GetName() method with the golden value "Mumbai"
- Check the GetDistance() method with other stations

    GetDistance()   GOLDEN VALUE
    ----------------------------
    Delhi           1447
    Bangalore       981
    Kolkata         2014
    Chennai         1338

- Check the output streaming operator on the above station


3. Railways

- Check for singleton property
- Check GetDistance() method for a few pairs of stations specifically checking for symmetric property as well

    GetDistance()       GOLDEN VALUE
    --------------------------------
    Delhi & Bangalore   2150
    Bangalore & Delhi   2150
    Delhi & Kolkata     1472
    Chennai & Delhi     2180

- Further checking of list of stations and dataset of the distances between them is done using the output streaming operator


4. Date

- Check all month names are properly loaded in sMonthNames
- Check for proper construction by comparing date_, month_, year_ with golden values

    Date(16, 3, 2001)

    ATTRIBUTE       GOLDEN VALUE
    ----------------------------
    date_           16
    month_          3
    year_           2001

- Check ToString() method with golden value "16/Mar/2001"
- Check output streaming operator

5. BookingClasses

- Check for singleton property for each of the 7 concrete booking classes
- Check the methods GetName(), GetLoadFactor(), GetNumberOfTiers(), IsSitting(), IsAC(), IsLuxury() for each of the 7 concrete booking
    classes and match with the golden output given below

        Method      GetName()       *GetLoadFactor()    GetNumberOfTiers()    IsSitting()    IsAC()    *IsLuxury()

    Methods marked with *
    Note that these constants are changeable from the Application space and 
    the tests are only for verifying if their value is being set properly.
    The tests above are based on the values currently set and may be changed by the user of the Application.

- Check the output streaming operator on each concrete class
- We check the polymorphic methods in the abstract base classes and the two non-polymorphic methods in BookingClasses

    -BookingClasses
        Check the GetName() and IsAC() methods for functionality. Golden values depend on the specialization used for testing.
    
    -SittingClasses
        Check the IsSitting() method (golden value: true) and GetNumberOfTiers() method (golden value: 0)
    
    -SleepingClasses
        Check the IsSitting() method (golden value: false)
    
    -Sleeping2Tier
        Check the GetNumberOfTiers() method (golden value: 2)
    
    -Sleeping3Tier
        Check the GetNumberOfTiers() method (golden value: 3)



APPLICATION TESTS

1. Given Tests
    Ran the given tests. The output has been put to OutputGivenTests.txt file.

2. Own Tests
    
    Exhaustive Test Plan split into two parts

        a. Check all classes for a particular pair of stations [7 tests, All class bookings from Delhi to Chennai]
            This ensures logic for fare computation for different classes is working fine
        b. Check all ordered pairs of stations for a particular class [20 Tests, All possible ordered pairs of stations in Sleeper]
            This ensures logic for fare computation between different pairs of stations is working fine
    
    The output has been put to OutputOwnTests.txt file.
